**Workshop:** Friday, Dec 2 2022<br>


We welcome submissions regarding the new frontiers of graph learning, including but not limited to:
- *Graphs in the wild:* Graph learning for datasets and applications without explicit relational structure (e.g., images, text, audios, code). Novel ways of modeling structured/unstructured data as graphs are highly welcomed.

- *Graphs in ML:* Graph representations in general machine learning problems (e.g., neural architectures as graphs, relations among input data and learning tasks, graphs in large language models, etc.)

- *New oasis:* Graph learning methods that are significantly different from the current paradigms (e.g., large-scale pre-trained models, multi-task models, super scalable algorithms, etc.)

- *New capabilities:* Graph representation for knowledge discovery, optimization, causal inference, explainable ML, ML fairness, etc.

- *Novel applications:* Novel applications of graph learning in real-world industry and scientific domains. (e.g., graph learning for missing data imputation, program synthesis, etc.) 




We welcome original research papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials). 
All accepted papers will be presented as posters. We will select 6 papers for oral presentations and 2 papers for the outstanding paper awards with potential cash incentives.

All submissions must use the [NeurIPS template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.

Should you have any questions, please reach out to us via email:<br>
